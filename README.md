# archeoProfile
This is the developing site for archeoProfile - a capture-based aeDNA taxa profiling toolkit for archeological sites.


# Planned steps:

Order | Task | States
--- | --- | --- | --- 
1 | Develop a list covering all key animal and plant species including subspecies and key varients, and collect their genomes to assambly a reference genome database | on-going
2 | Develop a pipeline to profile and autheticate the animal and plant taxa and resolve their phylogenies, based the shotgun sequencing data and the database assambled in setp 1 | on-going
3 | Develop capture probe set based on the database assambled in setp 1, and run hybridization capture (consider benchmarking) | to be performed
4 | Develop a pipeline to analyze the capture sequenced data | to be performed
